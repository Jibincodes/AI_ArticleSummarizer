## Analysis

### Scenario

As a group, we had decided to build a simple Python program that uses a simple and understandable GUI (which will be built with the help of PyQt5). With the decided use stories below, we have decided to use beautiful soup for parsing and the summarization has been done with the help of models available in hugging face platform.

### User Stories

1. As a user, I want to be able to quickly summarize a news article to see what's important without having to read the whole thing.
2. As a user, I want to summarize long news articles so that I can quickly understand the main ideas and decide whether to continue reading.
3. As a user, I want to extract answers to specific questions from news article summaries so that I can quickly find information without having to search through the entire text.
4. As a user, I want the application to be simple and easy to use, with clear instructions for entering article URLs, asking questions, and viewing summaries and answers.
